            The origins of the word "cocktail" have been debated. The first
            written mention of "cocktail" as a beverage appeared in The Farmers
            Cabinet, 1803, in the United States. The first definition of a
            cocktail as an alcoholic beverage appeared three years later in The
            Balance and Columbian Repository (Hudson, New York) May 13, 1806.
            Traditionally, cocktail ingredients included spirits, sugar, water
            and bitters; however, this definition evolved throughout the 1800s
            to include the addition of a liqueur.In 1862, Jerry Thomas published
            a bartender's guide called How to Mix Drinks; or, The Bon Vivant's
            Companion which included 10 cocktail recipes using bitters, to
            differentiate from other drinks such as punches and cobblers.
            Cocktails continued to evolve and gain popularity throughout the
            1900s, with the term eventually expanding to cover all mixed drinks.
            In 1917, the term "cocktail party" was coined by Mrs. Julius S.
            Walsh Jr. of St. Louis, Missouri. With wine and beer being less
            available during the Prohibition in the United States (1920â€“1933),
            liquor-based cocktails became more popular due to accessibility,
            followed by a decline in popularity during the late 1960s. The early
            to mid-2000s saw the rise of cocktail culture through the style of
            mixology which mixes traditional cocktails and other novel
            ingredients. By 2023, the so-called "cocktail in a can" had
            proliferated (at least in the United States) to become a common item
            in liquor stores. In the modern world and the Information Age,
            cocktail recipes are widely shared online on websites. Cocktails and
            restaurants that serve them are frequently covered and reviewed in
            tourism magazines and guides. Some cocktails, such as the Mojito,
            Manhattan, and Martini, have become staples in restaurants and pop
            culture.
